# CI/CD Using Jenkins
## Objective
To understand Continuous Integration pipeline using Jenkins including:         
- Automated build on code push                   
- Running validation tests                       
- Using environment variables                       
- Managing secrets                    
- Failure handling                    

## Tools Used
- Jenkins                
- GitHub               
- Shell Script              
- HTML Application                   

## Pipeline Stages  
1. Validation Test                 
2. Deploy               
3. Secret Handling             

## Trigger Mechanism
- Webhook / Poll SCM on every push                

## What I Learned
- How Jenkins automates CI pipeline             
- Creating Jenkinsfile                    
- Integrating GitHub with Jenkins                 
- Debugging failed builds                    
- Using credentials securely                  

## Output
- Successful pipeline execution                  
- Failure simulation and fix                      
- Stage wise logs verified
